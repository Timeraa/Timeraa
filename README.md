# Hi, I'm Florian Metz 👋

## 📖 My Story

I'm a 22-year-old DevOps developer based in Germany, and my journey into the world of software development has been a fascinating one. It all began when I was just a child, captivated by Minecraft plugins, which slowly but surely introduced me to Java (though I have since explored other paths).

My career gradually gained momentum as I delved into creating Discord bots, which steered me further in the direction of JavaScript and Node.js. However, my career truly took off when I had the captivating idea to create [PreMiD](https://premid.app), a small utility with more than half a million active users. PreMiD allows users to display their online activities, such as the Netflix shows they are watching, on their Discord profiles. This project marked a significant turning point and kickstarted my journey in the world of software development.

PreMiD not only introduced me to the world of frontend and backend development but also provided valuable experience in infrastructure management. It taught me many principles and best practices in software engineering. However, along the way, it also presented numerous challenges that I had to face, pushing me to continuously learn and grow as a developer.
