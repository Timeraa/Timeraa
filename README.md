# 🦄 Hi, I'm Florian Metz (aka Timeraa)! 👋

## 📖 My Story

<img src=".github/assets/Timeraa.png" align="right" width="200">

Greetings, fellow adventurers! I'm a 23-year-old DevOps developer from Germany, soaring through the clouds of code like a Pegasus on a mission. 🦄 My journey into the magical world of software development began when I was just a young colt, tinkering with Minecraft plugins and dipping my hooves into Java (though I've since galloped across various programming pastures).

As I spread my wings, I ventured into creating Discord bots, which lured me deeper into the enchanted forests of JavaScript and Node.js. But my true ascent into the stratosphere started when I conjured up [PreMiD](https://premid.app), a nifty little utility now cherished by over half a million active users! PreMiD lets you display your online escapades—like binge-watching Netflix shows—right on your Discord profile. This project didn't just launch me into new horizons; it also taught me to navigate the winds of frontend and backend development, infrastructure management, and the ever-changing weather of best practices.

## 🌟 Hobbies

When I'm not coding up a storm, you might find me:

- 🎶 **Jamming to Music:** From epic soundtracks to indie beats, music helps this Pegasus find his rhythm.
- 🎮 **Gaming Adventures:** Exploring virtual worlds and embarking on quests that challenge my strategic thinking.
- 🏞️ **Hiking Trails:** Stretching my legs (and wings) in the great outdoors, conquering scenic trails.
- 🎢 **Thrill Seeker:** Riding roller coasters and embracing the adrenaline rush—who needs wings when you have gravity-defying rides?
- 🎬 **Animated Escapades:** Diving into the creative realms of Disney and other animation studios where storytelling truly takes flight.

## 🚀 What I Do

- 🔧 **DevOps & Medior Developer at [AutoflexBV](https://github.com/AutoflexBV):** Gaining altitude in the realms of software development and DevOps.

- 💼 **Co-founder & CEO at [Recodive oHG](https://recodive.com/):** We're passionately reinventing the wheel (because who says a Pegasus can't improve it?), pushing the boundaries of innovation and excellence.
